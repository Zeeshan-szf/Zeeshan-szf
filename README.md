# Hi there, I'm Zeeshan Fahad 👋

## AI Systems & Cloud Infrastructure Engineer

> Building intelligent, self-healing infrastructure where AI meets DevOps

I architect cloud platforms that don't just run—they think, learn, and heal themselves. With 5.5 years of experience, I'm at the intersection of AI engineering and cloud infrastructure, creating systems that reduce toil and amplify human capability.

### 🚀 What I Do

- 🤖 **AI-Powered DevOps**: Building intelligent agents with LangChain, Vertex AI, and MCP for autonomous infrastructure management
- ☁️ **Multi-Cloud Architecture**: Designing scalable systems across GCP and AWS that handle millions of users
- 🔐 **Security-First Engineering**: Implementing RBAC, zero-trust architectures, and automated compliance
- 📊 **Observable Systems**: Creating unified monitoring with Grafana, Prometheus, and real-time anomaly detection
- 🎯 **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform modules and Kubernetes CRDs that turn infrastructure into poetry

### 💡 Recent Highlights

### 💭 Philosophy

```
"The best infrastructure is the one you never think about—
because it's intelligent enough to think for itself."
```

> The future isn't just automated—it's autonomous. I build systems that don't just execute commands; they understand intent, make decisions, and continuously improve. That's the intersection where I live.
